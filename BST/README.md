# Binary search tree (BST)

**Binary Search Tree (BST)** is also called **Sorted Binary Trees**.

**BST** is a particular data structure, that we can store any kind of type (numbers, characters, strings, or other structure...).

Each node of the tree can only have maximum **2** childrens.

# Insertion

# Deletion

# Search

# The complexity in Big O Notation
###### Time Complexity
| Type       | Best case | Average case | Worst case |
|------------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| **Insert** | O(1)      | O(log n)     | O(n)       |
| **Delete** | O(1)      | O(log n)     | O(n)       |
| **Search** | O(1)      | O(log n)     | O(n)       |

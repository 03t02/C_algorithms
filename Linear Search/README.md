The goal of this simple algorithm is to find an element in an unsorted array, and returns the index of this one.

The process is simple. We take our array, and iterate over it. For earch element, we compare this one to the element that we want to find.

Example: we have an array like this: `[1, 4, 5, 7, 0, 3, 2]`. And we want to know if the number `7` exists in this array. What we have to do is, compare each element to the number `7` until we find this number in our array.
